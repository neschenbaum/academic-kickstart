# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a postdoc at the University of St. Gallen and visiting scholar at the Düsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics. I do research in industrial organization and the economics of digitization, focusing in particular on the principles and functioning of dynamic pricing and related competition policy concerns. I am also interested in algorithmic pricing and the implications of automated decision making for market conduct and competition policy, as well as black market online platforms. I am currently on a four-year research grant obtained via the SNSF research project "Pricing in a Digital World".
