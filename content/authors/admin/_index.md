# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a postdoc at the University of St. Gallen. I do research in industrial organization and the economics of digitization. I am particularly interested in dynamic pricing, algorithmic pricing, black market online platforms, and generally competition policy concerns related to digitization. I am currently on a four-year research grant obtained via the SNSF research project "Pricing in a Digital World". Jointly with Philipp Zahn, I lead the research project "The Competitive Effects of Pricing Software Systems" that is funded by the University of St. Gallens Basic Research Fund.

I am a postdoc at the University of St. Gallen. In fall of 2020 I was a visiting scholar at the DICE. I do research in industrial organization and the economics of digitization. I am particularly interested in dynamic pricing, algorithmic pricing, black market online platforms, and generally competition policy concerns related to digitization. I am currently on a four-year research grant obtained via the SNSF research project "Pricing in a Digital World". Jointly with Philipp Zahn, I lead the research project "The Competitive Effects of Pricing Software Systems" that is funded by the University of St. Gallens Basic Research Fund.
