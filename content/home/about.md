## Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of St. Gallen. My research focuses on the economics of digitization, in particular the functioning of dynamic pricing and resulting competition policy concerns. I am currently on a four-year research grant obtained via the SNSF research project "Pricing in a Digital World".
