## \  \ 


I am a postdoc at the University of St. Gallen. I do research in industrial organization and the economics of digitization, in particular focusing on the principles and functioning of dynamic pricing and related competition policy concerns. I am currently on a four-year research grant obtained via the SNSF research project "Pricing in a Digital World".
